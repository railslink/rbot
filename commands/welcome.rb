          My name is RBot and I've got a few things to share with you.

          *We don't have many rules, but we do have a few:*

          1. Be nice to each other.
          2. Don't use `@everyone`, `@channel`, `@group` or `@here`.
          3. Don't ask if you can ask a question; just ask.
          4. Don't ask the same question in multiple channels.
          5. Wrap code in backticks. <https://slack.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/204977928/backticks.png|Example here>.
          6. See #1.
